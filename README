Dbserialize
===========

Dbserialize provides two rake tasks to store your current environments database
tables to Yaml fixtures in db/fixtures and to fill the database with these
fixtures.

That way it's possible to store sample data consistently in the repository and
for all developers on a project to use common sample data instead of manually
generating something on every developer machine or sending database dumps around
via email.


Example
=======

To save your database to Yaml call

    rake db:serialize:save
    
To resore the database from the fixtures call

    rake db:serialize:load

To only export certain tables, set the FIXTURES environment variable to a list
of table names seperated by commas:

    rake FIXTURES="users,posts" db:serialize:save
